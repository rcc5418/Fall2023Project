               <br/><strong>Sonic the Hedgehog has spent years fighting the forces of Dr.
                  Eggman.</strong>
               <br/><em>Within the Final Egg, Sonic faces off with the Egg Viper, an
                  enormous serpentine robot piloted by Dr. Eggman.</em>
               
               <br/><strong>Time and time again, the mad doctor attacks, Sonic strikes back, then
                  relaxes until Eggman returns.</strong>
               <br/><em>Atop the Final Forretress, Sonic battles the Egg Emperor, a
                  humanoide mecha equipped with a lance and shield.</em>
               
               <br/><strong>But after their last battle...</strong>
               <br/><em>Sonic stares down the Egg Dragoon, a flying robot with laser
                  wings and an imposing gatling gun arm.</em>
               
               <br/><strong>...Dr. Eggman vanished...</strong>
               <br/><em>Against an overcast sky, Sonic fights the Death Egg Robot, a
                  bulbous robot with a single glassy eye-like fixture and numerous tentacle
                  appendages.</em>
