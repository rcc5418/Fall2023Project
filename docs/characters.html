            <p>This page could include brief descriptions of all the characters that show up in the
                comic, as well as some statistics pertaining to how often they show up, how many
                lines they have, etc.</p>

            <img src="images/characters/sonic.png" class="characters" />
            <p class="characters"><span class="character_name">Sonic the Hedgehog</span><br />Sonic
                the Hedgehog is the world's fastest hedgehog! He is known for his lightning fast
                speed and his snarky attitude, and he is always here to save the day (and his
                friends!) from the evil Dr. Eggman!<br /> Total appearences: 257 panels<br />
                Sonic's arrogance is one of his defining characteristics, and the numbers certainly
                show it! He shows up in over 70% of the 356 total panels encoded, and using the
                XPath command <span class="xpath">//cbml:panel/note[contains(.,'pose')]</span>
                reveals that Sonic takes time out of his day to pose flashily multiple times per
                issue.</p>

        <section class="characters">
            <img src="images/characters/tails.png" class="characters" />
            <p class="characters"><span class="character_name">Miles "Tails"
                Prower</span><br />Miles "Tails" Prower is a young two-tailed fox who is Sonic's
                best friend. He was once bullied for having two tails, but despite his troubled
                past, he is a highly intelligent inventor and can even use his two tails to fly! He
                even has his own airplane known as the Tornado!<br /> Total appearences: 42
                panels<br /> Tails is one of gaming's most well-known sidekicks, a distinction
                further supported by IDW's comics. Using the XPath command <span class="xpath"
                    >//cbml:panel/@characters[contains(.,'#tails')][contains(.,'#sonic')]</span>, we
                can see that of Tails' 42 appearences, 33 of them are alongside his buddy Sonic.
                That's almost an 80% rate, nice consistency Miles!</p>

            <img src="images/characters/amy.png" class="characters" />
            <p class="characters"><span class="character_name">Amy Rose</span><br />Amy Rose is a
                pink hedgehog who is deeply in love with Sonic the Hedgehog. She is known for her
                joyful spirit and her trusty Piko Piko Hammer. She is also known for her
                fortune-telling skills that help predict her future.<br /> Total appearences: 58
                panels<br /> Amy has been characterized by her connection to Sonic for a long time,
                but that's recently been changing! She's one of the resistance's highest-ranking
                members, and in her debut issue, she actually has more lines than Sonic himself!
                Using <span class="xpath">//cbml:panel/cbml:balloon[@who="#sonic"]</span> and <span
                    class="xpath">//cbml:panel/cbml:balloon[@who="#amy"]</span>, we can see that
                while Sonic has 41 lines, Amy has 44!</p>
        </section>
        <section class="characters">
            <img src="images/characters/knuckles.png" class="characters" />
            <p class="characters"><span class="character_name">Knuckles the
                Echidna</span><br />Knuckles the Echidna is a red echidna who is the last living
                member of the Echidna tribe. He is known for his powerful fighting skills and can
                break through anything with his spiked knuckles, which is how he earned his name.
                Knuckles is also known for guarding the Master Emerald, a massive and powerful jewel
                that keeps his home, Angel Island, afloat.<br /> Total appearences: 50 panels<br />
                At one time, Knuckles was one of Sonic's toughest rivals, and while they've patched
                up their differences, the rivalry, in some small part, remains alive. Using <span
                    class="xpath">//cbml:panel/@characters[contains(.,'knuckles')]</span> and <span
                    class="xpath">//cbml:panel/@characters[contains(.,'sonic')]</span>, we can see
                that Knuckles is tailing behind Sonic by only 3 appearences, his 50 to Sonic's 53. I
                guess even after all these years, it's still Sonic, <i>&amp; Knuckles...</i></p>

                Cat is a princess cat from the Sol Dimension. As her name implies, Blaze is known
                for her fiery attacks that burn everything in their paths. She is also the guardian
                of the Sol Emeralds, seven jewels that bring immense power to the Sol
                Dimension.<br /> Total appearences: 39 panels<br /> Blaze is a strong, stoic
                character, by using <span class="xpath"
                    >//cbml:panel/cbml:balloon[@who='#blaze']</span> we can see that she only has 15
                lines. Using the robust XPath command <span class="xpath"
                    >//cbml:panel/cbml:balloon[@who='#blaze'] ! normalize-space() ! string-length()
                    => sum() div //cbml:panel/cbml:balloon[@who='#blaze']=>count()</span> we can see
                that her average line length is about 49 characters, as compared to something like
                Amy's average line length of 57 characters in her debut issue.</p>

            <p class="characters"><span class="character_name">Tangle the Lemur</span><br />Tangle
                the Lemur is a young civilian who is one of Sonic's newest friends. She met Sonic
                while she was protecting her town from an invasion of Dr. Eggman's Egg Pawn robots,
                and they have become great teammates. Tangle is an excitable, optimistic, and
                somewhat reckless fighter, though her extendable tail helps her get out of jams her
                careless fighting style gets her into.<br /> Total appearences: 56 panels<br /> The
                XPath command <span class="xpath">//cbml:panel/cbml:balloon[@who='#tangle']</span>
                reveals that Tangle has 27 lines in her debut, almost even with Sonic's 30. She's a
                pretty talkative lemur!</p>

            <p class="characters"><span class="character_name">Lanolin the Sheep</span><br />Lanolin
                the Sheep is another new friend of Sonic's. She first met Sonic when she was
                defending her hometown, Riverside, from Badniks. After Sonic helped Lanolin save her
                town, she became a member of the Restoration to ensure nobody's home would face the
                same demolition her's did.<br /> Total appearences: 5<br /> The bravest warriors
                come from the most humble of beginnings. Lanolin began as a simple background
                character, but thanks in part to her creator, Adam Bryce Thomas, who would continue
                to include her in issues he illustrated, she would rise to become a principal
                character.</p>

            <p class="characters"><span class="character_name">Rough &amp; Tumble the
                Skunks</span><br />Rough and Tumble are a pair of skunks who love nothing more than
                doing nothing, which is why they enslave an entire village and force its residents
                to serve their every want and need. They might come across as brutish pushovers, but
                don't knock this duo! They string along Sonic and Knuckles for an impressive 7
                pages. When Knuckles and Sonic beat up the brutes, they discover a new
                    passion...<b>REVENGE</b>!<br /> Total Appearences: 28(Rough)/27(Tumble)<br /> As
                they're complementary naming scheme and choreagraphed intro cutscene suggest, these
                two are practically inseparable. The XPath command <span class="xpath"
                    >//cbml:panel/@characters[contains(.,'tumble')][contains(.,'rough')]</span>
                shows us that of the pair's ≈28 appearences, 21 of them are made side by side.</p>

            <img src="images/characters/yacker.png" class="characters" />
            <p class="characters"><span class="character_name">Yacker</span><br />Yacker is a member
                of an alien species known as Wisps. Wisps are aliens from Planet Wisp that come in a
                variety of colors that bring special powers to Sonic depending on the color of the
                Wisp. Yacker acted as a guide for Sonic and Tails (and the player) in <i>Sonic
                    Colors</i>.<br /> Total appearences: 1</p>

            <p class="characters"><span class="character_name">Dr. Eggman</span><br />Dr. Eggman is
                an evil scientist who is Sonic the Hedgehog's archenemy. Not only is his IQ over 300, 
                Dr. Eggman is known to engineer a vast arsenal of ruthless robots who try and take
                down our speedy hero. He was originally known as Dr. Robotnik, but has been called
                Dr. Eggman by Sonic to make fun of him. Eggman has become so used to being called
                "Eggman" that he refers himself as that name since.<br/>
            Total appearences: 3<br/>
                Eggman has been solidly defeated, but his influence is still felt by all. Using the XPath command <span class="xpath">//cbml:panel/cbml:balloon[matches(.,'[Ee]ggman')]</span>, we can see that despite only appearing physically in 3 panels, in the first 4 issues, he's mentioned by Sonic and friends 15 times!</p>
        </section>
        <section class="characters">
            <img src="images/characters/cubot%26orbot.png"

                and Cubot are a pair of bumbling robots who are Dr. Eggman's henchmen. They usually
                help Dr. Eggman with his sinister plans, but they often goof up and do not do what
                Dr. Eggman programmed them to do.<br/>
            Total appearences: 2<br/>
                Using <span class="xpath">//cbml:panel/@characters[contains(.,'orbot')][contains(.,'cubot')]</span>
             we can see that these goof-offs stay true to their reputation. Rather than working hard 
            to help (apparently) Eggman, they're slacking off, only showing up in two panels in the 
            first 4 issues!</p>
