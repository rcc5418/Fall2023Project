                    Welcome to the homepage for the Fall 2023 DIGIT 110 final project! Our group members are very passionate about 
                a certain character, so we decided to do our project on none other than Sonic the Hedgehog! He's a pretty popular guy, having his 
                own cartoon, a billion video games, and 2 -- wait, 3?? -- movies! But how does the blue blur's signature charisma translate to the 
                pages of a comic? This project was performed both to answer that question, and deepen our understanding and appreciation for the 
                character/franchise as a whole.</p>
