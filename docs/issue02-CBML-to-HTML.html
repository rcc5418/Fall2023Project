               I don't have much to say, other than wanting to tell you that I'm TOTALLY STOKED.
               Sonic was my first comic book, and I'll be collecting this new series for as long
               as it runs.
               I've been trying to get a letter published in a Sonic comic since I was 8 - and now,
               at  31, I work at a comic book stare and have been actively pushing the IDW Sonic
               on anyone who'll listen. Full circle, huh?
               At the risk of sounding cliche, the new Sonic can't get here fast enough!
