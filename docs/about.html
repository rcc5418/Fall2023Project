                been a gamer girl since I was two, and I've been a huge fan of Sonic ever since I
                saw the first Sonic the Hedgehog movie in theaters on its release date in 2020! If
                you perform an XSLT search about how many times Sonic appears in our comics, you'll
                find lots of results! Not only is it because he's the main character; he's also my
                favorite character in the franchise, as well as my favorite fictional character!</p>

                video game design. I am Kayla's younger twin sister, and I have also been a gamer
                since I was two years old. I was a fan of Sonic the Hedgehog, as well as another
                SEGA franchise called Hatsune Miku: Project Diva when I was in high school. I'm sure
                that this project is WAY PAST COOL! </p></section>
