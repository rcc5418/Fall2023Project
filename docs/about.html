            <p>This page contains a brief summary of IDW's history</p>
            <p>This Sonic the Hedgehog comic book series was created by the American comic book company IDW. The proprietor of Top Shelf Productions, IDW has been developing and publishing various whimsical comic books and graphic novels since 1999. In 2002, IDW has reformed horror comic books after its successful release of Steve Niles and Ben Templesmith’s 30 Days of Night. IDW has also collaborated with other comic book publishers that are known for their key licensed brands, such as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Godzilla, and Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Because of IDW’s collaboration with other comic book publishers, crossover entries were released by IDW and their partner company altogether! Today, nearly 650 of IDW’s comic book entries are written in nearly 25 different languages to promote entertainment towards readers of all ages from around the world.</p>
            <p>The first Sonic the Hedgehog IDW comic book entry was released in April 2018, and its popularity has sparked new series of Sonic the Hedgehog comic books ever since, including a comic book of the 2022 video game Sonic Frontiers.</p>
