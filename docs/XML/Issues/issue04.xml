               means that the speaker of the line is unknown or unclear for some reason. In certain
               scenes, the comic might be implying a line is said by a character, but really have it

            <p>Hello Sonic Fans!<lb/>
               Here we are at the end of an unprecedented four week mad dash of Sonic! I had a blast
               writing it all, and my hat's off to the phenomenal production team that pulled off a
               monthly endeavor four times over. It'll make the regular once-a-month feel boring,
               right guys? ...guys? Tough crowd-moving on!<lb/>
               I hope you all have enjoyed our first four issues into Sonic's brand new comic
               adventures! I'm so excited for you to see what we have in store for the long run--pun
               unapologetically intended. It's going to be great to see some fan-favorites show up,
               and we've got some new faces who will spice things up as well! And! AND! I can barely
               contain my excitement, but I don't want to spoil it for you either.<lb/>
               As a life-long Sonic fan--and what feels like a lifetime spent writing the little
               blue hedgehog--you have my sincerest thanks for reading and supporting us as we get
               this new series underway. I couldn't be happier returning to Sonic's world, and I
               hope you enjoy it enough to stay with us for a long, long time.<lb/>
               Cheers,<lb/>
