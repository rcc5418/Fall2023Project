            <p> One of my earliest and clearest memories is when my big sis got my big bro a Sega
               for Xmas. The one that came with Sonic 2 and had him and Tails on the box. I remember
               doing my best to play Tails and help my bro get through levels as fast as we could.
               The cartoon was why I woke up on Saturday mornings. I remember I'd be up before
               anyone even without an alarm clock cuz I knew Sonic was gonna be on. </p>
            <p> I grew up with the blue blur. I've caught up to the comics til just before the end
               of the long run. Sonic has been my inspiration, motivation, and role model for
               decades. I always wanted to be like him. I'm nearing 30 years old now and still love
               everything Sonic. It's a kind of love and loyalty you cant lose. No matter how fast
               you run. Love you Sonic, hope this comic run lasts even longer than the last. </p>

            <p rend="blue-text"> That's really wonderful, Sadko! I'm glad that we get to play some
               small part in bringing Sonic to you. A lot of people have come to us and told us
               about how Sonic is a massive part of who they are, just like you did. That's a really
               amazing thing and we're so glad you shared! </p>
